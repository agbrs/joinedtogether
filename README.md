This repository has been added as an example for the agb library, so the latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/agbrs/agb/tree/master/examples/the-hat-chooses-the-wizard).

Play it at [lostimmortal.itch.io/the-hat-chooses-the-wizard](https://lostimmortal.itch.io/the-hat-chooses-the-wizard).


## Compiling

The [repository for agb](https://github.com/corwinkuiper/agb) gives instructions for what tools are required for using agb.
If you have these, then clone this repository and build away.
If mgba-qt is installed, then a `cargo run` will build and run the game.

## Changes

This code may have changed since the gamejam submission, the tag `gmtk-submission` contains *exactly* the code at the point of submission.
This may be difficult to compile due to requiring some special directory setup, so the tag `gmtk-submission-agb-versioned` contains a single change that means it is easier to compile.
